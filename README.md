# Genetic-Algorithm-for-Lot-Sizing

This project implements a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to solve a lot sizing optimization problem. The algorithm evolves solutions over multiple generations to minimize the total cost, which includes setup costs and holding costs while respecting inventory constraints.
